1-Bar plot:
1.1- Error Bar:
error bars will give you a general idea of how precise a measurement is. 
Error bars are useful to adevelopers because error bars show the confidence or precision in a set of measurements or calculated values. 
Bar charts without error bars give the illusion that a measured or calculated value is known to high precision or high confidence.
we can also calculate the standard deviation and make the length of the error bar represent it,
so it's easier to compare the standard deviation of each
